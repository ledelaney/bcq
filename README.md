# BIOS 196 Biology Colloquium

The Biology Colloquium (BCQ) is a class designed to generate a sense of excitement and community among biology majors about the (endless! amazing! breathtaking!) possibilities available to you here at UIC and after graduation. The BCQ team aims to accomplish this with cool field trips and interesting guest speakers, but we also hope to provide you with practical support and tools for success throughout the semester. Our goal is to create a welcoming and supportive community, and have some fun along the way.
