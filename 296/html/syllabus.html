        <h1>Overview and Goals</h1>
        <p>The Biology Colloquium (BCQ) is a class designed to generate a sense of excitement and community among biology majors about the (endless! amazing! breathtaking!) possibilities available to students here at UIC and after graduation. The faculty advisors, course coordinator, and student leaders all make up the BCQ team. As student leaders, you will likely have the greatest influence on the experience of your students. You will be the ones that set-up and manage field trips, answer student questions, and grade weekly assignments. It is our job to make sure that students get the most out of the BCQ experience and that everyone feels welcome.</p>

        <p><b>The most up-to-date information regarding course activities and materials can be found on</b> <a href="https://ledelaney.org/teaching/2021/bcq">BCQ course website</a>.</p>

        <h1>Job Title</h1>

        <p>You are a Student Leader! Wear this term with pride. BIOS 296 can be thought of as a developing leadership program, and we hope to make sure you get the most out of your experience as a leader in BCQ.</p>



        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Be respectful.</b></li>
            <li><b>Be considerate.</b></li>
            <li><b>Take care of each other.</b></li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Course Grades</h1>

        <p>We would be lying if we said that grades didn’t matter at all. But it’s important to remember that grades are simply a tool used by educators to track your progress in the course: they have no relevance to your value as a human being. We are here to serve you, regardless of how many points you earn in your classes. And, if you are struggling to keep up in this course or any other, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:ldelan5@uic.edu">reach out to Lucy</a>.</p>
