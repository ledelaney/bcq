        <h1>Overview and Goals</h1>
        <p>The Biology Colloquium (BCQ) is a class designed to generate a sense of excitement and community among biology majors about the (endless! amazing! breathtaking!) possibilities available to students here at UIC and after graduation. The faculty advisors, course coordinator, and student leaders all make up the BCQ team. As student leaders, you will likely have the greatest influence on the experience of your students. You will be the ones that set-up and manage field trips, answer student questions, and grade weekly assignments. It is our job to make sure that students get the most out of the BCQ experience and that everyone feels welcome.</p>

        <p><b>The most up-to-date information regarding course activities and materials can be found on</b> <a href="https://ledelaney.org/teaching/2021/bcq">BCQ course website</a>.</p>

        <h1>Job Title</h1>

        <p>You are a Student Leader! Wear this term with pride. BIOS 296 can be thought of as a developing leadership program, and we hope to make sure you get the most out of your experience as a leader in BCQ. Lucy is the Course Coordinator (technical term &equals; "Graduate Teaching Assistant").</p>

        <h1>Course Grades</h1>

<h2>Meetings</h2>

<h3>Three Meetings During Semester</h3>

<p>We will meet together as a group three times throughout the semester to check in and discuss various aspects of the course. These meetings will be scheduled as the semester progresses using Doodle to ensure that everyone can attend. The meetings will be virtual.</p>

<h2>Student leader biography &amp; picture</h2>

<h3>Due Friday, August 27</h3>

<p>Write a short biography of yourself (no more than 80 words!) that we will display on the course website. You can view a few examples <a href="https://ledelaney.org/teaching/2021/bcq/index.html#who-is-on-the-bcq-team">here</a>. Please include "likes", "dislikes", and "aspirations": these can be fun and are a great way for the students to see your unique personalities! Email to Lucy by the end of the first week of classes.</p>

<h2>Tentative field trip list</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, September 3</h3>

<p>The field trip landscape will be different following the last 18 months of pandemic life. This year, you will have a list of pre-approved on-campus locations to use while you set up your five field trips. This will involve some discussion amongst yourselves, since we would like to avoid groups attending the same locations at the same time. Please see the resources on our Blackboard page for the appropriate dates, the list of locations, and sample email templates. Make sure you CC Lucy on all communications related to BCQ!</p>

<h2>Pre-lecture activity</h2>
<h3>Approved by Lucy one week prior to your activity date</h3>

<p>Each student leader will be responsible for planning one pre-lecture activity before the presenter arrives on seminar days. Run-time for the activity will be approximately 30 minutes. We will decide in our first Student Leader meeting who will be responsible for each lecture warm-up activity. The number one goal of these activities is to get the students awake and engaged. The activities may or may not be related to biology, but should certainly be inclusive of all students.</p>

<h2>Pre-lecture warm-up questions</h2>
<h3>Email to Lucy by 11:59pm before lecture day</h3>

<p>Once we are all warmed up from our super-fun activity, we want to get the students comfortable talking in front of the group and participating. A big chunk of their grade is based on participation, so we want to provide lots of opportunities for them to do so! Every student leader will be responsible for dreaming up three open-ended questions to ask students in a group discussion setting. Examples of appropriate questions include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What is your favorite fact about biology?</li>
    <li>Where would you build your dream house and why?</li>
    <li>Where is your favorite spot in Chicago?</li>
    <li>What is your favorite animal and why?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Student leader involvement</h2>
<h3>Ongoing</h3>

<p>Speaking of participation, we want you all to be involved with BCQ as well! We love when you ask questions during lectures, help clean up the office or classroom, keep up with the group chat, and help coordinate activities. Also: take photos while your group is out-and-about so we can update our BCQ website!</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<h3>Ongoing, weekly</h3>
<p>Students will turn in one assignment each week, which you are responsible for grading based on the provided rubric. Please do your best to complete grading within one week of the assignment due date. If you ever feel confused about what to do, you are always welcome to reach out to Lucy! Your overall grading responsibilities consist of:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Grading weekly assignment turned in on Box</li>
    <li>Keeping track of weekly attendacnce and participation</li>
    <li>Giving extra credit when earned</li>
</ol>

<p><b>A note on extra credit:</b> Students may earn up to a maximum of 2 points per day. You must also note the particular <i>reason</i> that the extra credit was earned (e.g., asked a particularly insightful question of a speaker, stayed late to clean up, won a trivia game, went above and beyond in a field trip situation, etc.). If you are not sure what counts as extra credit please ask!</p>

<p>Student leaders <i>do not</i> grade student leader evaluations or final papers.</p>

<h2>Mid-course reflection paper</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, October 8</h3>

<p>Write one paragraph addressing each of the following questions (each question worth 3pts):</p>

<ol>
    <li>What do you feel your strengths are as a student leader so far?</li>
    <li>What do you feel you need to work on for the remainder of the semester?</li>
    <li>What activities have you enjoyed the most, or what is something that you've gotten out of being a student leader so far?</li>
    <li>What are you excited about for the coming weeks?</li>
    <li>Is there anything Lucy can do to support you better in your role as student leader (or in your role as University student)?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final paper</h2>
<h3>Due Wednesday, December 8</h3>

<p>Write one paragraph assressing each of the following questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Which field trips have you taken and which were the most popular?</li>
    <li>Which lecture did your students/and you like the most and why?</li>
    <li>In what ways did the relationship between you and your student group grow and develop over the course of the semester?</li>
    <li>What pre-lecture activities do you feel created the most engagement among the group?</li>
    <li>How did you feel keeping up with your responsibilities as a student leader? Did you struggle at all?</li>
    <li>How was the rest of your semester and your other classes? Are you settling in to being back on-campus?</li>
    <li>What would you do to improve the class?</li>
    <li>How would you rate the performance of the Course Coordinator (Lucy)? Specifically, what was beneficial to the course and what could be improved?</li>
    <li>Are you interested in joining us as a student leader again next semester?</li>
    <li>List out the studentâ€™s grades and point total out of 300. If a student received a grade below a C, provide a brief explanation.</li>
