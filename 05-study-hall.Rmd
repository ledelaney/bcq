# Drop-in Hours

![](images/study-hall.png){width="70%"}

Instead of traditional "drop-in" hours, course coordinator Lucy will hold informal "study hall" sessions on a variety of topics. Come by to chat about:

+ Creating and honing resumes or CVs
+ Applying to graduate schools
+ Finding undergraduate research opportunities
+ Building study skills for tough classes
+ Learning basic computational skills: Making websites, creating beautiful documents, automating mindless homework tasks, and more!

These sessions will be very relaxed and anyone is welcome to come by for any amount of time.
