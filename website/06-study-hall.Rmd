# Study halls

Instead of traditional "drop-in" hours, course coordinator Lucy will hold "study hall" sessions on a variety of topics. To get a sense of what everyone would find useful, we will wait to finalize this list until after the first week of classes. Possible topics include things like:

+ Creating and honing resumes or CVs
+ Applying to graduate schools
+ Finding undergraduate research opportunities
+ Building study skills for tough classes
+ Learning basic computational skills: Making websites, creating beautiful documents, automating mindless homework tasks, and more!
