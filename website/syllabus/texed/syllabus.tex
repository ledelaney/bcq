There are no prerequisites for this course, and there is no textbook. On some weeks we will meet together as a group for activities and guest speakers in the BCQ classroom. On other weeks, you will go on field trips with your student leader in a smaller group (locations for field trips will be determined later).

\section{Overview and Goals}

The Biology Colloquium (BCQ) is a class designed to generate a sense of excitement and community among biology majors about the (endless! amazing! breathtaking!) possibilities available to you here at UIC and after graduation. The BCQ team aims to do this with cool field trips and interesting guest speakers, but we also hope to provide you with practical support and tools throughout the semester. Our goal is to create a welcoming and supportive community, and have some fun along the way.

\section{Meet the BCQ Team}

\section{Expectations}

This course is also a community. To that end, everyone is expected to treat others with respect. We have a general expectation of positive vibes only.

\subsection{For the BCQ team}

The BCQ team is responsible for creating a welcoming environment. 

\subsection{For students}

We want all students to be active participants each week. Generally, this means showing up to class or field trips on-time, engaging in class activities, and respectfully listening to guest speakers.

\section{Policies}

If you need any accommodations to participate in this course, make sure to register with the Disability Resource Center and inform the course coordinator within the first three weeks of class. If you need help contacting the Office of Disability Services (ODS) or assistance for any other reason, please contact the course coordinator.

\faPhone\ Office of Disability Services 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413-0123 (TTY)

\subsection{Course grades}

We would be lying if we said that grades didn’t matter at all. But it’s important to remember that grades are simply a tool used by educators to track your progress in the course: they have no relevance to your value as a human being. We are here to serve you, regardless of how many points you earn in your classes. And, if you are struggling to keep up in this course or any other, do not hesitate to reach out to your student leader or course coordinator.
