# Study Halls

![](images/study-hall.png){width="70%"}

Instead of traditional "drop-in" hours, course coordinator Lucy will hold informal "study hall" sessions on a variety of topics. To get a sense of what everyone would find useful, we will wait to finalize this list until after the first week of classes. Possible topics include things like:

+ Creating and honing resumes or CVs
+ Applying to graduate schools
+ Finding undergraduate research opportunities
+ Building study skills for tough classes
+ Learning basic computational skills: Making websites, creating beautiful documents, automating mindless homework tasks, and more!

These sessions will be very relaxed and anyone is welcome to come by for any amount of time. Also, there will be snacks. Just saying.
