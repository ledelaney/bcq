# Field Trips

![](images/field-trip.png){width="90%"}


Student leaders will be responsible for setting up field trips every other week based on the relevant interests of students in their group. Your student leader will keep you updated about where you will meet and what your activity for that week will be. Make sure you have GroupMe and are included in your group's chat for more details.
